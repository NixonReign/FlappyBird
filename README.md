📝 Description:

This project is a simple Flappy Bird clone developed using Java with the entire code written and managed using VIM editor and custom VIM snippets. It's a console-based or lightweight window-based game (depending on your setup) that replicates the classic Flappy Bird gameplay mechanics — tapping to keep the bird flying and avoiding obstacles.

🛠 Key Features:

🐦 Flappy Bird-style jumping logic

📦 Obstacle spawning and collision detection

⏱ Game loop using Java Threads or Timer

🧠 Simple scoring system

⚙ Lightweight — no external libraries used

💻 Fully written and maintained using VIM + Snippets, showcasing keyboard-only development


🎯 Goal: To demonstrate building a mini-game using only keyboard tools (VIM) and core Java, suitable for learning game loops, graphics handling (basic), and OOP structure in Java.
